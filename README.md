Hello, my name is Yanyan Hu and I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering, in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uh.edu/) at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). My Ph.D. research focuses on deep learning techniques for electromagnetic forward and inverse modeling, as well as geophysical joint imaging. My internships further honed my expertise in machine learning, data science, and E-Commerce guidance.


- 🔭 I'm currently working on deep perceptual losses for multi-physics joint imaging
- 💬 Ask me about deep learning, CNN, RNN, GNN and joint inversion theory
<!-- - 👯 I’m currently collaboratively working on Antarctic geophysical imaging -->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Generative AI, LLM, Diffusion Models
<!-- - 🤔 I’m looking for help with 3D Bayesian inversion, especially using unstructure mesh -->
